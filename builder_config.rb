We can also add :only and :except elements to the hash which are both arrays of 
method name symbols.  If the :only option exists then only methods named in the 
:only array will do anything, all other methods will return immediately.  Any 
methods named in the :except array will do nothing and return immediately.

@builders = {
  RailsBuilder => {:output => './mywebapp' ,:appname => 'myapp',
  # do not do anything for these methods
  :except => [:finalize_menu, :build_model, :build_controller] },
  
  AngularRailsBuilder => {:output => './mywebapp',:appname => 'myapp',
  # don't do anything except finalize the menu
  :only => [:finalize_menu]}
}

We can also specify the fields to display for each type of display, e.g
@fields = {
  :except => [:id,:created_at,:updated_at],
  :detail => {
    :users => [:email,:gender,:birthday]
  },
  :form => {
    :users => [:email,:name,:gender,:birthday]
  },
  :list => {
    :users => [:email,:name,:gender,:birthday],
    :places => [:lat,:long,:map_link]
    }
}
